How to arrive at taxable income in kenya
    - The taxable income is calculated by subtracting allowable deductions 
      and exemptions from the gross income. The taxes owed are then calculated 
      based on the taxable income and the tax rates set by the Kenyan government.

Tax credits and reductions
    Tax credits and deductions reduce your taxable income and lower your tax liabilities.
    Some of the common tax credits and deductions available in Kenya include 
        - personal relief, 
        - contributions to approved retirement funds, 
        - and medical expenses. 

I use this online calculator as an exanmple for my calculations:

how nssf rates are calculated for the employee
    - Any gross salary amount >= 18000 nssf amount paid is 1080
    - Amount paid is 6% of gross salary for Tier 1 (ksh 6000)
    - Any amount > 6000, for example, 12000. The nssf amount is calculated as follows
        Tier 1 = 6% * 6000 = 360
        Tier 2 = (12000 - 6000) * 6% = 360
        Total nssf amount = 360 + 360 = 720

Insurance Relief
    Insurance relief is granted to an employee who has paid insurance premiums for life or 
    health or education polices for himself, his wife or child.

    Relief is given at 15% of premiums paid up to a maximum of Kshs 60,000 per annum.
    For education and health, the policy should have a maturity period of at least 10 years.

    From 1st January 2022, contributions to National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) qualify 
    for insurance relief.
